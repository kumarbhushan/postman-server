postman-server: The node.js Postman server
==========================================

Postman is a Google Chrome extension to make sharing links with your friends
instant and effortless.

Go install it [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ceebmhkhkjlbcehplmobnnhbibghnenj)

**This is the server part.** Find the source to the client [here](https://github.com/obeattie/postman-client).

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) ([WebSockets](http://websocket.org/))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Cluster](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/)

(and there are a few other libraries here and there that you'll see if you read
the code :)

P.S. Just how awesome is it that as a weekend project you can build a real-time,
WebSockets, JavaScript, all-singing, all-dancing sharing service?! These
technologies really are amazing.

The people behind the curtain
-----------------------------

As we're sure you can see from the commits, this is a little "few-weekends
project" gift to the world from two guys who found it too difficult to share
links with one another:

…and from our company, [Emberbox](http://www.emberb0x.com/), where we're busily
working away building truly awesome products.
